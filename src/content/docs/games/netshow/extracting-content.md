description: How to extract question packs, audio, and game data from YDKJ Net Show installers.

import { Steps, Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';


The YDKJ Net Show's revival success depends heavily on extracting the game's **question packs** and **audio clips** — the core content that makes YDKJ fun.

---

## What Needs to Be Extracted

| Asset | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Question packs | The trivia questions (text + answers) |
| Audio commentary | The JACK host's voiced reactions |
| Video segments | Intro/outro video clips (if any) |
| `Dispatch.ini` | Server routing config |
| `UpdateScript.ini` | Content manifest |
| Game data files | Miscellaneous game engine data |

---

## Versions

| Version | Notes |
|---|---|
| **1.0** | Original release, smaller content set |
| **1.5** | Expanded questions + media |
| **Sports** | Sports-themed question packs |

---

## Extracting the Installer

<Steps>

1. **Obtain the installer** from abandonware archives. Look for:
   - `ydkj_netshow.exe` (1.0 or 1.5)
   - `ydkj_sports.exe` (Sports)

2. **Extract with 7-Zip:**
   ```bash
   7z x ydkj_netshow.exe -o./extracted/
   ```

3. **Look for question pack files.** YDKJ typically stores questions in proprietary formats (`.jrb`, `.jck`, or similar). Use a hex editor to identify the format.

4. **Look for audio files.** The JACK host commentary may be stored as `.wav`, `.mp3`, or a proprietary format.

5. **Locate `Dispatch.ini` and `UpdateScript.ini`** in the installation directory.

</Steps>

## Original File Examples

The BezerkIRCDocs repository includes original example files:

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| [`Dispatch.ini`](https://github.com/SecondSight05/BezerkIRCDocs/tree/rewrite/%3COriginal%20File%20Examples%3E) | Original dispatch config |
| [`UpdateScript.ini`](https://github.com/SecondSight05/BezerkIRCDocs/tree/rewrite/%3COriginal%20File%20Examples%3E) | Original update manifest |
| [`shell.cfg`](https://github.com/SecondSight05/BezerkIRCDocs/tree/rewrite/%3COriginal%20File%20Examples%3E) | Shell configuration |

These are valuable references for understanding the expected format.

<Aside type="note">
YDKJ Net Show question packs and audio are still a significant unknown in the revival effort. If you have reverse-engineered the file formats, please contribute to the community documentation!
